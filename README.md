<h3>Goal and Skills</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to build a simple web page that has header, hero(main $ secondary), quote section and footer. Additionally, I will practice my current HTML and CSS skills using the knowledge I have gained thus far in my "The Odin Project" coursework.</p>

<p>The skills I will demonstrate in this project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a new repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Cloning the repository</li>
<li>Using git commands (add, commit, and push)</li>
<li>Creating an HTML boilerplate</li>
<li>Creating headings and paragraphs</li>
<li>Creating relative links</li>
<li>Creating unordered and ordered lists</li>
<li>Adding an image with appropriate alt text and image size attributes</li>
<li> Applying the knowledge of flex</li>
<li> using CSS to style the project to make it more presentable</li>
<li>Publishing my Landing Page website to be accesible to others via the web</li>
</ul>
